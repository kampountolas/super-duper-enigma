I am an Associate Professor in the [Department of Mechanical Engineering](http://mie.uth.gr/) at the [University of Thessaly](https://www.uth.gr/), Volos, Greece. Before to joining UTH, I was a Senior Lecturer with the James Watt School of Engineering at the University of Glasgow (UofG, 2013-2019), United Kingdom, and an Associate Director at UofG's Urban Big Data Centre (2019). I was research fellow at [Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne](http://www.epfl.ch) (EPFL, 2012-2013), Switzerland, visiting researcher scholar at the [University of California, Berkeley](http://berkeley.edu), CA (2011), and post-doctoral researcher at the [Centre for Research and Technology Hellas](http://www.certh.gr/root.en.aspx), Greece (2010). I was also short-term visiting professor at Technion–Israel Institute of Technology, Israel (2014), Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden (2016), and the Federal University of Santa Catarina, Florianópolis, Brazil (2016; 2019). 

I received my Dipl.-Eng. degree in Industrial Engineering, an MSc in Operations Research, and the PhD degree in the modelling, control and optimisation of large-scale transportation networks from the [Technical University of Crete](http://www.tuc.gr/3324.html).

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
